# üë®‚Äçüíª How to use Triton to Generate Tensor Programs to Optimize for Algorithms

This project aims to optimize various important algorithms using OpenAI's Triton.

## What is Triton?

OpenAI's Triton is an open-source Python-like programming language which enables researchers with no CUDA experience to write highly efficient GPU code‚Äîmost of the time on par with what an expert would be able to produce.

## Why use Triton?

Using Triton to optimize algorithms can significantly improve their performance, making them faster and more efficient. The aim of Triton is to provide an open-source environment to write fast code at higher productivity than CUDA.
